Problem 1:
Given two polynomials represented by two lists, write a function that efficiently multiplies given two polynomials.
Example: 
The lists [2, 0, 5, 7] and [3, 4, 2] represent the polynomials 2 + 5*x**2 + 7*x**3 and 3 + 4*x + 2*x**2.
Their product is: 6 + 8*x + 19*x**2 + 41*x**3 + 38*x**4 + 14*x**5 
which is represented by the list [6, 8, 19, 41, 38, 14]
