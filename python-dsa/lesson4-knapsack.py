Modified Solution for the Knapsack Problem - Return the list of elements whose profits make up the maximum profit.

Originally the Knapsack problem statement was:
Given n elements, each of which has a weight and a profit, determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the elements weighing 
no more than w.

Write a modified version of the max_profit function that returns the list of elements selected to maximize profit.
